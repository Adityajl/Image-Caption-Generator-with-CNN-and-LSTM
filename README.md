# Image-Caption-Generator-with-CNN-and-LSTM
This project demonstrates an image caption generator built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with PyTorch. Leveraging the COCO dataset, the model extracts features from images using CNNs and generates descriptive captions using LSTMs, showcasing the integration of computer vision and natural language processing.
